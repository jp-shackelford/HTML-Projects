#HTML-Projects

This README will be updated as I create more HTML projects.
It currently contains:

	Speed Reader:
	An HTML project where a user can paste in text into the text box,
	and the program will display the text one word at a time for the
	user to practive speed reading.
	The page includes speed and size options for the shown text.
