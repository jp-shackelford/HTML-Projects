#HTML-Projects

This README will be updated as I create more HTML projects.
It currently contains:

	Speed Reader:
	An HTML project where a user can paste in text into the text box,
	and the program will display the text one word at a time for the
	user to practive speed reading.
	The page includes speed and size options for the shown text.

	Fifteen:
	An HTML project that creates a sliding puzzle game for the user.
	The page includes a shuffle button to mix up the game board. The
	point of the game is to arrange the numbers from 1 to 15, left-
	to-right, top-to-bottom.
